How to copy Octree to GPU

How to traverse the octree without using recursion

Copy octree of unknown size to the kernel -> flatten the tree into a array
 
OpenCL/DirectCompute does not support copying classes to the kernel -> convert OctreeNode to structure sOctreeNode
 
DirectCompute queue class/struct, cannot unroll while-loop
